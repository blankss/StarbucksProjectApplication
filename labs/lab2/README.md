## Spring Lombok
### ValAndVarUserDemo
**a.** The Lombok Annonation or Feature being tested <br/>
  The feature being tested for ValAndVarUserDemo.java would be lombok.val, which has the functionality of declaring a local variable without specifying the type of the   variable. EX: _var money_ and _var userName_ are not specified to a type in the code. <br /><br />
**b.** How does the Output verify your understanding of the Feature being tested? <br />
  When the code was ran, we could see that the variable _userName_ is of type String and the variable _money_ is of type BigDecimal. This makes sense as _money_ is set   to a BigDecimal type of 53.00 and later 80.00 and userName is set to a String type of "Hello World". By running this piece of code, the feature is shown to work as     even though the code does not specify the type of the variable, lombok.val infers the type from the intializer expression. <br /> <br />

### GetterSetterUserDemo
**a.** The Lombok Annonation or Feature being tested <br/>
  For the GetterSetterUserDemo.java, the feature being tested would be lombok.Getter and lombok.Setter, which supports the feature of letting lombok generate the         default getter and/or setter methods for the annotated variables. In this case, the code specifies generating the getter and setter methods for the private instance   variable _userName_ and only a getter method for the private instance variable _userAge_. <br /> <br />
**b.** How does the Output verify your understanding of the Feature being tested? <br />
  When we look at the output generated by the print function of FieldLevelGetterSetterDemo.java, we can see all the methods that the java file has. Even though we have   not specifically written the getter and setter methods for _userName_. <br /> <br />
