## Spring Lombok
### 1. ValAndVarUserDemo
**a.** The Lombok Annonation or Feature being tested <br/>
  The feature being tested for ValAndVarUserDemo.java would be lombok.val, which has the functionality of declaring a local variable without specifying the type of the   variable. EX: _var money_ and _var userName_ are not specified to a type in the code. <br /><br />
**b.** How does the Output verify your understanding of the Feature being tested? <br />
  When the code was ran, we could see that the variable _userName_ is of type String and the variable _money_ is of type BigDecimal. This makes sense as _money_ is set   to a BigDecimal type of 53.00 and later 80.00 and userName is set to a String type of "Hello World". By running this piece of code, the feature is shown to work as     even though the code does not specify the type of the variable, lombok.val infers the type from the intializer expression. <br /> <br />

### 2. FieldLevelGetterSetterDemo
**a.** The Lombok Annonation or Feature being tested <br/>
The Lombok feature being tested in this case would be lombok.Getter and lombok.Setter, which allows the developer to have Lombok automatically generate getter and setter methods for their instance variables without writing the methods themselves by using the annotations of @Getter and @Setter for desired variables. In this case, the code specifies generating the getter and setter methods for the private instance variable _userName_ and only a getter method for the private instance variable _userAge_. <br /> <br />
**b.** How does the Output verify your understanding of the Feature being tested? <br />
When we look at the output generated by the print function of FieldLevelGetterSetterDemo.java, we can see all the methods that the java file has in its contents. Even though we have not specifically written the getter and setter methods for _userName_ and a getter method for _userAge_, we see that in the ouput, the print method has printed out all the existing methods in the FieldLevelGetterSetterDemo.java file, which has the generated methods of _setUserName(java.lang.String)_, _getUserName()_, and _getUserAge()_. <br /> <br />

### 3. GetterSetterUserDemo
**a.** The Lombok Annonation or Feature being tested <br/>
Similar to the previous demo, the GetterSetterUserDemo.java file demonstrates the Lombok features of lombok.Getter and lombok.Setter, which supports the feature of letting lombok generate the default getter and/or setter methods for the annotated variables. However, in this case, since the annotations for @Getter and @Setter are used right outside of the class declaration of GetterSetterUserDemo, the getter and setter methods are generated for all of theinstance variables of the class. <br /> <br />
**b.** How does the Output verify your understanding of the Feature being tested? <br />
From the output, we see that there are getter and setter methods for _userId_, _userAge_, and _userName_. This verifies my understanding of Lombok automatically      generating getter and setter methods for all the instance variables in our class when the annotation tags are located right above the class declaration. The methods of _getUserId()_, _getUserAge()_, _getUserName()_, _setUserId(int)_, _setUserAge(int)_, and _setUserName(java.lang.String)_ are all automatically generated by Lombok. <br /> <br />

### 4. ConstructorUserDemo
**a.** The Lombok Annonation or Feature being tested <br/>
The Lombok feature being tested in this demeonstration would be the generation of constructors, specifically @AllArgsConstructor and @NoArgsConstructor. These features of @NoArgsConstructor and @AllArgsConstructor are used to generate a constructor with no parameters and a constructor with 1 parameter for each instance variable of the class respectively. <br /> <br />
**b.** How does the Output verify your understanding of the Feature being tested? <br />
Although _getMethods()_ does not explicitly return the constructor of our class, we can easily verify our understanding of how @AllArgsConstructor and @NoArgsConstructor work by either attempting to instantiate our object with the instance variables, or we can call _getConstructors()_ in addition to _getMethods()_ to get both the methods and constructors that the class contains. _getConstructors()_ is also an available method in java.lang.reflect.*;.<br /> <br />

### 5. DataUserDemo
**a.** The Lombok Annonation or Feature being tested <br/>
The Lombok feature being tested in this demo would be lombok.Data, which is a feature of Lombok that generates @Getter, @Setter, @ToString, @EqualsAndHashCode, and @RequiredArgsConstructor functionalities all in one annotation. As touched on before, @Getter and @Setter generates getter and setter methods for our instance variables and @RequiredArgsConstructor generates a constructor with one parameter with a specified field/instance variable that needs special handling. @EqualsAndHashCode generates and implements the _equals(Object object)_ and _hashCode()_ methods. <br /> <br />
**b.** How does the Output verify your understanding of the Feature being tested? <br />
From looking at the method signatures being printed, we can see the @Data annotation at work due to the different methods that were not written by the developer but instead generated by Lombok. As seen before, we see the getter and setter methods for _userId_, _userName_, and _userAge_. Then, we see the methods of _hashCode()_ and _equals(java.lang.Object)_ from the @EqualsAndHashCode annotation and _toString()_ from the @ToString annotation. <br /> <br />

### 6. NonNullUserDemo
**a.** The Lombok Annonation or Feature being tested <br/>
For the last demo, the Lombok feature being demonstrated would be Lombok.NonNull, which essentially checks whether or not a parameter of a method or a constructor is null; if it parameter is null, then a NullPointerException would be thrown. The annotation goes before the parameter in question when the developer is trying to use the @NonNull annotation tag. <br /> <br />
**b.** How does the Output verify your understanding of the Feature being tested? <br />
When we run NonNullUserDemo.java, we can see that the feature works correctly as a java.lang.NullPointerException is thrown since we have passed in a null for String _userName_ while using @NonNull annotating for the parameter. With @NonNull, we can safely check whether or not a parameter is null or not, which is important as unchecked nulls may cause bugs in our code. <br /> <br />
